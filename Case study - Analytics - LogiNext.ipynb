    "\n",
    "The next step is to parse the address. Parsing consists in break up the address string into fields that compose the address, breaking up of address into specific fields. To parse we have to assume a structure for the address.\n",

    "This task consists in rebuild the normalized text to a final form. It will be done after the match phase.\n",

    "Name Entity Recognition on address\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Split address by field (prefix, location, suffixes)\n",
    "retrieve match candidates (search engine)\n",
    "Match address with candidates by similarity\n",

    "## Match\n",
    "One approach is to retrieve candidates from the in-house database that are similar to the address we want to normalize. Search engines do that using different strategies. We’re not going to detail this process, so let’s just say that our search engine returned candidates to be compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these candidates we do a comparison with our target address using some metric of similarity. There are several of such metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Jaro distance\n",
    "    2. Jaro-Winkler distance\n",
    "    3. Cosine distance\n",

    "I've chosen Jaro-Winkler distance. We compare the target address with each of the candidates and rank by the similarity between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Search engines\n",
    "\n",
    "Search engines usually already make the string similarity comparison to retrive the candidates, so it could, in principle, already compute the similarity score withou the need to program it by ourselves. But sometimes the search engine similarity algorithm cannot be tuned to the type of text, like addresses. We also have more information than only the Location string, like the postal code and suffixes. This could help in the decision process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NER\n",
    "Instead of using regular expressions to break up the address text into components we could create a Named Entity Recognizer and let it separate the address by fields.\n",

    "## Decision process\n",
    "After the text normalization and match we hopefully have a list of candidates with a similarity score between the target and a canonical address. How we decide if the address is indeed the correct address? We can set a score threshold, for example, based on our experience, and test the error rate. We also can create a classification model and train manually with some entries."
